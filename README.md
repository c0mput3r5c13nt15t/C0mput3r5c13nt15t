<b>Hello 👋</b><br>
I’m Paul Maier and I'm a 17-year-old student from Germany.

<b>My interests 👀</b><br>
I'm pretty much interested in everything that has to do with computer science, but my focus lies on:
- Web development (Fullstack)
- Web design
- Theoretical stuff (Algorithms, Maths, etc.)
- Programming languages (especially esoteric ones)
- Cybersecurity, Capture-the-Flag

<b>My current projects 🌱</b><br>
- Building useful software for my school (@Birklehof/teams-name-generator, @Birklehof/teams-name-generator, etc.)
- Attending the lecture "Informatik 1: Einführung in die Programmierung" (Computer Science 1: Introduction to Programming) as a "Schülerstudent" (pupil student) at the university of Freiburg
- Diffenrent competitions ([Bundeswettbewerb Informatik](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/), etc.)

<b>Collaborations 💞️</b><br>
I'm not really planning on collaborating on anything, but I'm open for it!
